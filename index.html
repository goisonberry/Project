        <p>
          I have always enjoyed working with my hands. Unfortunately, I did not
          have the ability to work on a car or was very good at drawing.
          However, something inside of me still felt like there was another way
          to work with my hands. That is when I discovered webpage and
          application development. At that moment I realized it was still
          possible to work with my hands. However, this time I would be working
          on developing something that many people can benefit from.
        </p>

          One of the many things I enjoy other than webpage and application
          development is the love for comic books and Honda cars. Especially
          restoring my <a href="mugen.html">2008 Honda Civic Mugen Si</a> One of
          my recent interests/hobbies is collecting and selling Funko Pops!
          These are a few things that I primarily enjoy that have helped
          continue to myself balanced between what I want to do and what I can
          do.
